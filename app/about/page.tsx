            Welcome to ZEVANY, where luxury meets the timeless art of Indian craftsmanship. Our jewelry is not just an accessory—it is a story, a tradition, and a piece of art, handcrafted in the heart of Jaipur, India.

            <strong>How Our Custom Handmade Jewelry is Created:</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>1. Sourcing the Finest Gemstones:</strong> Our journey begins in Jaipur, the gemstone capital of India. We handpick ethically sourced precious and semi-precious stones—emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and more—each selected for its unique color, clarity, and character.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>2. Designing with Passion:</strong> Our master designers sketch each piece, blending traditional Rajasthani motifs with modern elegance. Every design is tailored to highlight the natural beauty of the gemstones and to reflect the individuality of its wearer.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>3. Handcrafting by Artisans:</strong> Skilled artisans in Jaipur use age-old techniques—hand-setting, engraving, filigree, and enameling—to bring each design to life. Every ring, necklace, earring, and bracelet is meticulously crafted, ensuring exceptional detail and durability.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>4. Customization:</strong> We offer bespoke services, allowing you to choose your gemstones, metals, and design elements. Our team works closely with you to create a one-of-a-kind piece that tells your story.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>5. Finishing Touches:</strong> Each piece undergoes rigorous quality checks and is polished to perfection, ready to become a cherished heirloom.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>Why Jaipur?</strong> Jaipur is renowned worldwide for its gemstone legacy and skilled artisans. By crafting our jewelry here, we honor centuries-old traditions and support local craftsmanship, ensuring every ZEVANY piece is truly special.
